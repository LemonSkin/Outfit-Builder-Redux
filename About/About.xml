  <description>Easily create and update your pawn outfits with the click of a button.

When you force wear clothing, you can now right click on the Clear Forced button to bring up a context menu.

Save Outfit: Create or overwrite an outfit policy sharing the name of the pawn. Only currently equipped items will be set to allow. All special filters (tainted, biocoded, etc), as well as quality and hit-point thresholds will be inherited from the currently selected policy. Forced wear is then released.

Save As: WIP/Not Implemented - Bring up a dialogue box to allow user to enter a name. If policy with that name exists, it will be overwritten following the inheritance rules as above.

Update Outfit: Update the current policy to allow all equipped items on the pawn. Does not disallow anything, all special filters and thresholds will remain. Forced wear is then released.

Clear Forced Apparel: Same as left clicking the button.
